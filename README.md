# Unified Mentor - Netflix Data Visualization and Prediction

Welcome to the **Unified Mentor** project! This project focuses on Netflix data visualization and prediction to determine whether a title is a **movie** or a **TV show**.

## Project Overview

In this project, we explore Netflix's dataset, perform data visualization, and build a predictive model to classify titles.

## Project Structure

- **Dashboard App**: The main application interface is built using Streamlit and is located in `dashboard.py`.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: All EDA is done in `research.ipynb`.

- **Model Training**: The model is trained and stored in the `model_training.py`.

## Data Storage

Data is dumped into **MongoDB** using a `.env` file to manage credentials.
